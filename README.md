# Motivational_Books

Your limitation—it's only your imagination.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Sometimes later becomes never. ...
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Dream it. ...
Success doesn't just find you. ...
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Dream bigger.
